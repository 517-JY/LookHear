# LookHear

This is a project to develop a world-wide database of multi-camera/multi-microphone recordings of musical ensembles,
together with interfaces which allow visitors to switch their view of the performance in real-time to any of the other
view points. Each view point also shows the score being played and the position in the score. The user can scroll back
and forth through the piece as well as through the different views.

To enter a new piece into the repository the user must log in and then upload each of the videos corresponding  to the
different viewpoints. They must also animate the score by listing to the recording and marking the place in the score
at every measure (or more frequently, depending on the piece).
